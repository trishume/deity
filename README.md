Book of Deity
=============

Chapter 1: Introduction
-----------------------
1. In the beginning, Stephen Bourne created the Bourne Shell.
2. And the Bourne Shell asked the Programmers, "Am I good, Programmers?"
3. And the Programmers said, "Yea, thou art good."
4. And the Bourne Shell inspired Programmers to create more Shells such as bash and zsh in its image. And the Programmers saw that the Shells were good.

Chapter 2: The Problem
----------------------
1. Then came complicated projects with preprocessors such as Sass and Coffeescript and application servers.
2. And the Shells were discovered to be limited as they could not intelligently run many Programs at once without the Programmers having to babysit the Shells and the Programs.
3. Now, Arthanzel was quite fed up with all this babysitting.
4. And Arthanzel downloaded Node.js.
5. And Arthanzel ~~worked~~ billed for six days and six nights of tending to the Javascript Code.
6. On the seventh day Arthanzel had finished the work he was doing.
7. Then Arthanzel released his Code to Github where it will benefit all of the Programmers and called his Code, 'Deity'.

Chapter 3: The Quite Few Commands and Commandments
----------------
1. Deity is a Script and a Daemon that intelligently run many Programs at once such as Sass and Coffeescript and application servers without the Programmers having to babysit the Sass and Coffeescript and application servers.
2. And the Documentation to Deity read all these words:
3. Deity shall run a Daemon to intelligently run many Programs at once.
4. Thou shall execute `deity new GLaDOS glados.sh -i --cake` to create a new Process called GLaDOS. And the command that shall be executed will be `glados.sh` with flags `-i` and `--cake`.
5. Thou shall execute `deity list` to list all Processes started by Deity and see their names and PIDs.
6. Thou shall kill Processes started by Deity by executing `deity kill GLaDOS` and the Process that shall be killed will be the Process whose name is GLaDOS.
7. Thou shall exit the Daemon and all Processes started by Deity by executing `deity exit`.
8. Thou shall force exit the Daemon by executing `deity force`.
9. Thou shall not force exit needlessly, as it may leave zombie processes and memory leaks.
10. Thou shall hold no creators of Diety above Arthanzel (respect the MIT license and don't mooch credit).
11. **Thou shall not complain if Diety deletes your computer for Deity is a work in progress and you shall be ignored.**

Roadmap
=======
- Run checks whether a process exists already exists before starting a new one.
- "in" and "out commands" to manipulate the stdio and stdout.
